# Arduino
Sources of my shared arduino projects currently maintained on codebender

{RC-PWM-To-LEGO-PowerFunctions} converts a PWM signal from a typical RC receiver to the IR protocol used by Lego Power Functions. 
Requirements:
- 3 IR leds
- Arduino board (I used the Mini Pro but any Arduino compatible board can be used
- RC receiver (The most types can be used here. I use a Spektrum receiver)
- Battery (I use a simple rechargeable 9V battery for this)
