# Arduino
Sources of my shared arduino projects currently maintained on codebender

The ´RC-PWM-To-LEGO-PowerFunctions´ sketch converts a PWM signal from a typical RC receiver to the IR protocol used by Lego Power Functions. 
**Requirements:**
* 3 IR leds (I connect them in series and connect them to a digital output on the Arduino).
* Arduino compatible board (I used the Pro Mini but any Arduino compatible board can be used.
* RC receiver (The most types can be used here. I use a Spektrum receiver).
* Battery (I use a simple rechargeable 9V battery for this connected to the RAW input on the Pro Mini)
